3. Iterating Fast Locally on a Production-Like Stack
Let’s say you want to keep the final architecture—Lambda, API Gateway, a real Postgres, real auth, etc.—but still develop locally in a Next.js-like manner (fast feedback). The key is to use local “emulators” or “offline modes” for each piece:

Serverless Offline:

With the Serverless Framework, you can run serverless offline (or serverless offline start) to spin up a local API Gateway + Lambda environment.

You can edit your Lambda code, save, and watch your “offline environment” reload. (It’s not quite as fast as Node’s hot reload, but it’s fairly close.)

Local Postgres:

Spin up Postgres in Docker on your machine with the same schema you’ll use in production.

Connect your offline Lambda environment to this local DB. This means your queries, migrations, etc. match production exactly.

If you prefer, you can connect to an actual RDS dev instance in the cloud, but that might slow you down with network latencies.

Auth:

If you’re using Cognito, you can set up LocalStack or rely on mocks for dev. LocalStack emulates many AWS services, including Cognito. But it’s a bit heavier to configure.

If you’re using Clerk, you can still run your Clerk integration locally by setting environment variables.

If you’re doing custom JWT, you can just run your own local JWT creation and verification.

Frontend (Expo Web + React Native Web):

Start with expo start --web to get instant hot reload for the UI.

Point your API calls at http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port Serverless Offline is using).

That way, changes to your Lambdas or the UI can be tested in real-time. No need to deploy code to see if it works.

Pros/Cons of This Approach**:

Pros: You keep your code nearly identical to production. The friction of deploying to AWS is minimal for local testing.

Cons: Tools like LocalStack or Serverless Offline can occasionally be finicky. The iteration speed is good, but not always as instant as a single Node process restarting.

In short, you can definitely stick to your production stack from day one—and just rely on offline emulators and local containers. This ensures minimal differences between dev and prod. But if you’re brand new to some of these services, the overhead might slow down your earliest experiments, which is why some prefer a simpler MVP approach first.
